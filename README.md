EyePiece(EP) AFOV is independent of scope.
You can calculate it if you have all the paI prefer to MEASURE it directly, like my sketch below:
EP AFOV in degrees= 2* the angle "a",  also equates to : 2*arctan(y/x)
With a bit of smoke in a dimly lit room, you can SEE the exit pupil crossover point and measure 
from there to the screen where the light circle is projected to ( I just use the white ceiling as my screen).
